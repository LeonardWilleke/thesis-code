# Oscillator

This model is used for the partitioned simulation of an oscillator with three springs and two masses. The oscillator is cut in the middle spring for partitioning. Here, two springs with one mass between them are calculated. This model can be used to simulate the left partition as well as the right partition, as they are symmetric.
